# Scala guide

A scala style guide I've assembled and taken around with me over the years, as well a collection of
FAQ-style "gotchas" covering some of the most common mistakes I've seen.

The style guide is a layer on top of the official scala guide to clarify points which I think are
missing or not reflecting standard practice in the community, but for anything I don't specifically
cover I recommend referring to the official style guide.

Much of this is my opinion, which I justify as I go.

* **[Style guide](style/main.md)**

* [Tips & common gotchas](tips/main.md) (mostly aimed at those learning scala)

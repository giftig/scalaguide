# Scala guide

A collection of tips, tricks, and notes I've made about scala style and some scala gotchas
which I've taken with me from place to place.

Much of this is my opinion, which I justify as I go.

The style guide is a layer on top of the official scala guide to clarify points which I think are
missing or not reflecting standard practice in the community, but for anything I don't specifically
cover I recommend referring to the official style guide.

Style guide is here: [Style guide](style/main.md)
